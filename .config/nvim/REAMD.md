### issues
I am using the new neovim setup for lsp, but i couldn't get lsp to be loaded. The issue was that i wasn't requiring lsp in my init.lua...
At the moment I can't get the lua language server to work. The binary is not execuatebale. I think the solution is th use the prebuild binaries instead of building from source. But this is for another day.
Building the lsps from source is a hassle. fin a way to use mason
