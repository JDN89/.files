### issues
Can't debug nvim plugins or source code. I've tried to set it up for lua, but i didn't get it to work and with the baby not enough time to focus on this issue atm. I'll continue reading docs in my freetime and see what else I can do.
to set it up follow:
[Debugging your Neovim configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47UGK4NgvC8)
start with a clean slate,  just for lua and see if I can get it to work
